These are few projects that I worked related to Data Visualization


Project 1: (Iris Flower Classification) 

Summary: 
1. The dataset was classified according to the height and width of petals and sepals. An Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) was conducted to deepen the understanding of the data.
   
2. Pair plots were utilized to visualize the relationships between pairs of features, with different species highlighted in varying colors. Box plots were employed to examine the distribution and identify any outliers for each feature. Additionally, a heatmap was created to assess the correlation among various attributes. For data preprocessing, the Label Encoder was utilized.
   
3.The dataset was subsequently divided into training and test sets to facilitate the training of multiple models. Models trained included Logistic Regression, K-Nearest Neighbors, Support Vector Machine, Naive Bayes, Decision Tree, and Random Forest.
